# 2. TL2a and TL2b alteranate properly, left then right. Furtheremore TL4 now joins them
# 3. TU-pdl alternate left/right and are all together

# They are tagged as left, presumably since they have dendritic and axonal

# one can see that magenta neurons CL1b-L7 and CPU1a type1-R7 really are very 
# similar in everything but the lamination of their dendrites in CBU vs CBL

# This actually includes the axon terminal arborisation zones, which look very
# similar across these 3 plotted subgroups  -  even for the CL1b-L7 and CPU1a type1-R7.

# Conclusion: NBLAST clustering does not reveal all the subtypes
# according to the same scheme as human anatomists because it uses different
# invariants (in this case position across the whole neuron favouring staves of
# the central complex rather than lamination between the ellipsoid body vs
# fan shaped body.

# However the finest subtypes in this final dendrogram to co-cluster, e.g.
# CPU1a L5/R5/R4
# this suggests to me that if we had rather more data, NBLAST would indeed
# reliably co-cluster the finest level of cell type in this region.
