## Cool! But maybe we also want to see it's template brain? 
## Let's check if they have it

available.brains

## Great, they do, let's get it
butterfly.brain = insectbraindb_read_brain(species = "Danaus plexippus")

## And plot as a wireframe

## Oop, that's a lot of neuropils. 
## Let's go for only a subset. What's available?
butterfly.brain$RegionList
butterfly.brain$neuropil_full_names

## There lateral horn (LH) and the antennal lobe (AL) are my favourites.
## Let's plot those

# the neurons seem to be rather densely sampled

# Plotting all neuropils in one go with alpha is pretty slow.
# Instead we can combine them into a single mesh

# subsample to 10% of number of nodes

# add vertex normals for smoother looking plot

# now plot
