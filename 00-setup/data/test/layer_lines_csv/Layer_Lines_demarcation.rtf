\f0\fs24 \cf0 Layer lines were demarcated using a segmented line in Fiji.\
The X,Y coordinates of the line (in pixel values) were extracted in .csv format. \

\cf0 \'97>ATTENTION: (if it will actually make any impact, theoretically it should) my pixel counter 0,0 coordinates are at the top left corner (Y=0 is at the top, X=0 is at the left), while for the microns it starts (0,0) at the bottom, left corner\'85 I know this might be confusing and presumably it might fuck up the scaling to microns for Y coordinates?\
\
The image used (a 2D max projection of the original image stack in which the bouton/axon marking/tracing was done) has the following dimensions\
 (X,Y)(microns, pixels): (2353.39x1968.56,5669x4742)\
2.4089 pixels/micron\
\
So if you can project these lines\'92 coordinates to all z dimensions, I suppose they can be used to segment the axon traces and bouton locations to layers.\
\
The original stack (where the tracing/marking was done) has 121 z-stacks and voxel depth: 1.524980 um, and pixel width and height 0.4151329um.\
\
All these parameters of course (dimensions,z-number, etc) will vary from neuron to neuron.\
\
Hope this info helps - let me know how it works out.\
